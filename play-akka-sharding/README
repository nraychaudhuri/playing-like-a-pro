To test this application follow these steps:
=====================================

- Run there instances of play application

```
run -Dhttp.port=9001 -Dakka.remote.netty.tcp.port=2551

run -Dhttp.port=9002 -Dakka.remote.netty.tcp.port=2552

run -Dhttp.port=9003 -Dakka.remote.netty.tcp.port=2553
```

> Note: We need to have start akka on port 2551 since it is configured as a seed node in application.conf file
> Note: Make sure you hit the index page of each running play app so that cluster is formed. It is lazy in dev mode
and not required for prod mode.

- Then using curl we can do following:

```
#This will create the user actor in first node
curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:9001/create/user/chad

#We update the user state in 3rd node
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:9003/update/user/chad?newState=winner
```

If everything works you should see the update message is processed by the actor in first node.
